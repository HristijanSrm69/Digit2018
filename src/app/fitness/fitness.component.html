        <p> Absolutely no one is a fitness expert on day one of their journey.
             That’s why so many people use personal trainers or experts to assist them in reaching
              their fitness goals. There are trainers and experts who specialize in fitness for people 
              with disabilities. You have access to a professional just like everyone else. There’s
               someone who will understand your goals and how to help you reach them. Assuming that you 
               won’t be able to get the right kind of assistance will only prevent you from bettering
                yourself.

                                                The sport provides many
                                                benefits. Besides improving overall health, cholesterol levels, and
                                                lung function, running is a confidence booster, a stress reliever, and
